# Packages

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following Caveats were applied:

* [x] Must NOT be [**associated with a mainstream distro**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] (Excluded: [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository), [GURU](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU), [NUR](https://nur.nix-community.org/) etc)
* [x] Must have an active development i.e **no abandonware**
* [x] We included the top 4 (5) Projects that met the above critera & had the most number of packages
{% endhint %}

### Total

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="97" data-type="number">AM</th><th width="93">Brew</th><th width="99">Pacstall</th><th width="79">PPKG</th><th>PkgForge (Soar)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2613</td><td>7256</td><td>658</td><td>995</td><td>4748</td></tr></tbody></table>

[^1]: We allowed [Pacstall](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall), as it's a community project & NOT backed by any distro. We could have included the [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) too, but we already have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for reality checks...
