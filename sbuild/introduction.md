# Introduction

A <mark style="color:purple;">**`.SBUILD`**</mark> file is a build script in spirit of [APKBUILD](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/APKBUILD_Reference) & [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD), but fear not, it is much more flexible & forgiving.\
It is a [<mark style="color:blue;">yaml file</mark>](https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://spacelift.io/blog/yaml) & should be relatively easier to read, understand & write.
