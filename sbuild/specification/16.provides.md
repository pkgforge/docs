# 16.Provides

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```yaml
#Example ONLY
# $pkg itself will always be a default value, so not needed if contains only 1 program and that 1 program is $pkg itself
provides:
  - "prog-a"
  - "prog-b"
```
{% endcode %}

* [x] This is Optional & can be left empty or removed completely (**TYPE**: <mark style="color:green;">**`RECOMMENDED`**</mark>)
* [x] This lists all programs that are fetched/built during the <mark style="color:purple;">**`x_exec.run`**</mark> part.
* [x] If this field is empty or doesn't exist, the interpreter will use <mark style="color:purple;">**`$pkg`**</mark> as the only value of <mark style="color:purple;">**`provides`**</mark> by default.
* [x] If this field exists, soar will treat it as a <mark style="color:purple;">**`$pkg`**</mark> family containing all programs from <mark style="color:purple;">**`provides`**</mark>
* [x] <mark style="color:orange;">**`soar install`**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">**`$pkg`**</mark> by default, will install all programs from <mark style="color:purple;">**`provides`**</mark>. This is the same as `$pkg` when `provides` is empty/nonexistent.
* [x] <mark style="color:orange;">**`soar install`**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">**`$pkg/$prog`**</mark> will only install <mark style="color:purple;">**`$prog`**</mark> from the <mark style="color:purple;">**`$pkg`**</mark>'s <mark style="color:orange;">**`.SBUILD`**</mark>
* [x] Can have single or multiple entries

### alias

{% hint style="info" %}
It is possible to  specify <mark style="color:blue;">**aliases**</mark> with <mark style="color:purple;">**`:`**</mark> as a separator, **provided that the original $prog is the first value** (Only used for <mark style="color:blue;">**METADATA**</mark>)

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```yaml
#Example ONLY
# $pkg itself will always be a default value, so not needed if contains only 1 program and that 1 program is $pkg itself, however we can name it explictly if the prog is also known by another name with :
provides:
  - "prog-original:prog-alias"
  #Example:
  # - "chaos:chaos-cli" --> Chaos is same as `.pkg`, but since `chaos-cli` is also defined, searching for either chaos:chaos-cli will return the same result
  
#If a $pkg has multiple aliases, it can be specified by using : before each alias
provides:
  - "prog-original:prog-alias-1:prog-alias-2:prog-alias-3"
```
{% endcode %}
{% endhint %}

### symlink

{% hint style="info" %}
It is possible to specify <mark style="color:blue;">**symlinks**</mark> with  <mark style="color:purple;">**`==`**</mark>  as a separator, **provided that the original $prog is the first value**

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```yaml
#Example ONLY
# $pkg itself will always be a default value, so not needed if contains only 1 program and that 1 program is $pkg itself, however we can name it explictly if the prog is also meant to be Symlinked with known by another name with ==
provides:
  - "prog-original==prog-symlink"
  #Example:
  # - "busybox==whoami" --> busybox is the main program , but since `whoami` is also defined, soar will create a whoami symlink that points to buysbox
  
#If a $pkg has multiple symlinks, it can be specified in this way
provides:
  - "prog-original==prog-symlink-1"
  - "prog-original==prog-symlink-2"
  - "prog-original==prog-symlink-3"
```
{% endcode %}
{% endhint %}
