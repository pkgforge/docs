# 6.BuildUtil

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```yaml
#Example ONLY
#WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS TO INSTALL STUFF LIKE GIT as that is known not to work as static binary
#This should only be used for static bins, (use build_dep instead CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED)
#soar will add these using soar dl temporarily in cache prior to running the x_exec part
#if these are already installed/cached by soar, soar will skip them (Unless Upgrade is found)
build_util:
  - "curl" #for web stuff
  - "jq" #for parsing json
  - "ouch" #to extract archives easily without remembering flags
```
