# Dynamic

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is only for testing & **Portable Static Binaries should Always be preferred**
{% endhint %}

* [x] If the binary is a desktop app i.e. needs desktop integration, it needs to go under [**./packages**](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs/tree/main/packages)
