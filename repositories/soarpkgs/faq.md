### **Is this really an AUR?**

1. [**Soarpkgs**](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs) is inspired by the concept of the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository), but **is not an exact replica**. While the AUR is a community-driven system where users can freely submit packages by creating repositories and `PKGBUILDs` with minimal oversight, [**Soarpkgs**](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs)  takes a more controlled approach.
2. The key distinction is in how packages are added. [**Soarpkgs**](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs) implements a **review system** where **maintainers must evaluate and approve packages** before they can be included in the repository. This extra layer of scrutiny helps maintain higher quality standards and better [**security**](security.md) compared to the AUR's more open submission process.
3. So while  [**Soarpkgs**](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs)  was influenced by the AUR concept, it's not truly an AUR since it prioritizes curated content over unrestricted user submissions.

### What makes Soarpkgs trustworthy if the AUR is viewed as a security risk?

1. The AUR isn't inherently a security nightmare if you exercise common senseâ€”like reviewing `PKGBUILD`s before installation or avoiding outdated packages.&#x20;
2. Unlike the AUR, where anyone can upload a package, **we require maintainers to manually review, evaluate & locally test all `SBUILDS`in a sandbox before approving any new submission/PR**.&#x20;
3. We also go as far as forking any third party repository we use, under the [**pkgforge-community** ](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-community)org.
4. We have a detailed section dedicated to it here: [https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/soarpkgs/security](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/soarpkgs/security)

### Cache

Cache refers to prebuilds provided by pkgforge's CI that soar uses by default. Think of it as the [Chaotic AUR](https://aur.chaotic.cx/) or [Homebrew's bottles](https://docs.brew.sh/Bottles).

Currently, our cache is of two types:

{% hint style="info" %}
* [x] [Bincache](../bincache/) provides prebuilt Static Binaries ([soarpkgs/binaries](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs/tree/main/binaries)): [cache.md](../bincache/cache.md "mention")
* [x] [Pkgcache](../pkgcache/) provides prebuilt GUI Apps ([soarpkgs/packages](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs/tree/main/packages)): [cache.md](../pkgcache/cache.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

### GLIBC vs MUSL

[MUSL](https://musl.libc.org/) is indeed slow, See:

* [https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/images-compiled-programs/glibc-vs-musl](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/about/images-compiled-programs/glibc-vs-musl)
* [https://martinheinz.dev/blog/92](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/92)
* [https://andygrove.io/2020/05/why-musl-extremely-slow/](https://andygrove.io/2020/05/why-musl-extremely-slow/)
* [http://www.etalabs.net/compare\_libcs.html](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html)

However, we use  [**`mimalloc`**](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc)  over other the default musl allocators, and also prefer [**LTO**](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LinkTimeOptimization) &  [**PIE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code) , this means the packages we compile from source have identical performance to their GLIBC counterparts, sometimes even faster.

### Portability

We wrote a [manifesto](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs/blob/main/MANIFESTO.md), and we stand by it. And thus, we do the following to ensure we guarantee at least some level of portability for each package:

{% hint style="info" %}
* [x] We provide prebuilt packages as [#cache](faq.md#cache "mention")so user don't have to build packages themselves. This avoids user's having to install some common dependencies to build a package.&#x20;
* [x] Dependency heavy packages for instance typically involve docker containers, so we mark these kind of **SBUILDs** with a [**note**](../../sbuild/specification/15.note.md):

```yaml
note:
  - "[DO NOT RUN] (Meant for pkgforge CI Only)"
```
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* [x] We have written dedicated documentation about each format & their portability, you can find them at [${format}/portability](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/packages)
* [ ] You can also specifically filter & only use portable packages at the **expense of size**, we add a special [**note**](../../sbuild/specification/15.note.md) if we are confident the package works on Any Linux

```yaml
note:
  - "[PORTABLE] (Works on Any LIBC)"
```
{% endhint %}

### **Why not contribute Upstream?**

1. Unfortunately, with the [**mass adoption of Flatpaks**](https://flatpak.org/), most developers have no interest in AppImages or [**other formats**](../../formats/packages/)
2. The few who do, either lack the interest, skill or time, or all of these to provide a properly made Portable Package. There are numerous examples, you simply need to see their issues tab & search our usernames.
3. So, creating PR that the upstream won't even accept is a huge waste of our time. However, we (mostly [**@Samueru-sama**](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-dev/people#samueru-sama)) still try our best to contribute upstream whenever possible.

### Why not contribute & collaborate with AM?

{% hint style="info" %}
* We ([**@pkgforge**](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/people)) & [AM's Author](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) are friends. &#x20;
* [**AM**](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) _has added partial support for some of_ [**PkgForge's Reposotories** ](broken-reference)since [**`Nov 10, 2024`**](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/pull/1096/files), thanks to this [**Issue**](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/issues/1079): [**https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/issues/1079**](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/issues/1079)
* So everything listed below is meant for a technical comparision & **NOT to harass/insult either side**. So please be decent & don't misquote us.
{% endhint %}

1. [**AM**](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) is a giant beast, & [is entirely in shell](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. This makes it very hard, if not impossible, to create <mark style="color:purple;">**CLI**</mark>/<mark style="color:purple;">**GUI**</mark> in a real programming language, as **there's no programmatic data format like&#x20;**<mark style="color:blue;">**`JSON`**</mark>/<mark style="color:blue;">**`YAML`**</mark>**.&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**Parsing strings from shell scripts is neither safe nor reliable**</mark>.
2. We fix & patch any & all missing or broken components in any Package we add/build. This means, most soarpkg no longer resemble the "source", wheras AM has a policy that states "it's better to rely on/contribute to upstream, **even if upstream has no interest or provides broken packages"**. You can read, why we disagree: [#why-not-contribute-upstream](faq.md#why-not-contribute-upstream "mention")
3. [**Soar**](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) prioritizes <mark style="color:orange;">**Security**</mark> through its implementation in <mark style="color:orange;">**Rust**</mark>, a memory-safe programming language. We are committed to maintaining rigorous security standards, including comprehensive <mark style="color:orange;">**Build Logs**</mark>, robust <mark style="color:orange;">**Checksum**</mark> validation, and secure build and installation <mark style="color:orange;">**Sandboxes**</mark>. **These protective measures are fundamental to our approach and non-negotiable.**
4. **A&#x20;**<mark style="color:green;">**safer**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**saner**</mark>, <mark style="color:purple;">**easier**</mark> & <mark style="color:blue;">**richer**</mark> alternative to hacky-shell script was created, it's called [<mark style="color:purple;">**`SBUILD`**</mark>](broken-reference), You can read about it here: [**https://docs.pkgforge.dev/sbuild/introduction**](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/sbuild/introduction) & unless AM ever starts using it, the recipes are entirely incompatible.
5. The reasons, listed above, make [**PkgForge**](https://github.com/pkgforge)'s & [**AM**](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM)'s **philosophy & goals incompatible** for a direct collaboration.

### History & Lore

* [**@Azathothas**](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/people#azathothas) drafted repos & projects which would eventually become [Toolpacks](https://github.com/Azathothas/Toolpacks),  \~ **July, 2023**, You can read more about it here: [https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/bincache/faq#history-and-lore](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/bincache/faq#history-and-lore)
* After [Azathothas/Toolpacks#28](https://github.com/Azathothas/Toolpacks/issues/28), [PkgCache](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/pkgcache) was created **\~ Sep 25, 2024**, You can read more about it here: [https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/pkgcache/faq#history-and-lore](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/pkgcache/faq#history-and-lore)
* We realized it pretty quickly that, [PkgCache](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/pkgcache) wasn't sustainable, and a User Repository consisting of community submitted packages, just like [**ivan-hc/AM**](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM), was desperately needed. Thus, [Soarpkgs](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs), came into existence [`~ Nov 04, 2024`](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs/commit/47b3023010232dfe8b13a83a1daa688e57aa21f1)
