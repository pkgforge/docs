### History & Lore

* [**@Azathothas**](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/people#azathothas) drafted repos & projects which would eventually become [Toolpacks](https://github.com/Azathothas/Toolpacks),  \~ **July, 2023**, You can read more about it here: [https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/projects/toolpacks-bincache/faq#history-and-lore](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/projects/toolpacks-bincache/faq#history-and-lore)
* Life was fun & everything was okay until: [Azathothas/Toolpacks#28](https://github.com/Azathothas/Toolpacks/issues/28), this made [**@Azathothas**](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/people#azathothas)  go down a rabbit hole where he discovered formats like: [AppBundles](https://github.com/xplshn/pelf/) `|` [AppImages](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) `|` [FlatImages](https://github.com/ruanformigoni/flatimage) `|` [RunImages](https://github.com/VHSgunzo)
* Those didn't really fit the theme of [Toolpacks,](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/projects/toolpacks-bincache/differences) and thus this repo came into Existence **\~ Sep 25, 2024** , later it served as an ingestor, after [**SoarPkgs**](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/projects/soarpkgs/faq#history-and-lore) [`~ Nov 04, 2024`](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs/commit/47b3023010232dfe8b13a83a1daa688e57aa21f1)
