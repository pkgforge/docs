# Nests

{% hint style="success" %}
* [x] Nests are self hosted repositories that build & release packages on their own Account/Org/Repository/Registry. Think of them as [homebrew's tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps), but easier & better
* [x] For Developers, Nests are an easy way to distribute their applications easily & seamlessly to the target system or any \*Unix based distro
* [x] For Users, Nests are an easy (& quicker) way to get their favourite applications as soon as new releases are made without waiting for any package manager (including us) to package it first.
