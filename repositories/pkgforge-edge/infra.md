{% hint style="warning" %}
[bin.pkgforge.dev](https://bin.pkgforge.dev) is not a real webserver. It is a [r2 bucket](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), and loads all objects upon each request. Thus, the load times are very slow & you are better of using [**Soar**](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar)
{% endhint %}
