### Broken & Not Portable Packages

* [x] If you find a [**`$PKG`**](../../../../formats/packages/) that doesn't work (<mark style="color:red;">**`segfaults/crashes`**</mark>) or some other <mark style="color:red;">**errors**</mark>, it **will be treated as a bug**.

### **Why not host on GitHub?**

1. Because GitHub has very conservative limits: [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)
2. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/pricing) has [generous limits](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/repositories-recommendations) & [inbuilt support for LFS](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/repositories-getting-started)
3. Last but not least, to avoid [https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/projects/pkgcache/dmca-or-copyright-cease-and-desist](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/orgs/pkgforge-core/projects/pkgcache/dmca-or-copyright-cease-and-desist)
