# DMCA | Copyright (Cease & Desist)

{% hint style="warning" %}
All Binaries are hosted on Cloudflare, and NOT GitHub. GitHub only contains scripts & source code.
{% endhint %}

If you/your project/software uses a license which forbids binary distribution, and you would like to take down the binary:

1. First, having such clause and disallowing people to distribute binaries, will harm only your own popularity/ potential user increment
2. Second, this Repository **DOES NOT STORE ANY PREBUILT ARTIFACTS ANYWHERE**.
3. This Repository **DOES NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY CONTENTS OTHER THAN** [**BUILD RECIPES**](https://github.com/Azathothas/Toolpacks/tree/main/.github/scripts).
4. If you have no problems with any major package managers like [brew](https://brew.sh/), [NixPKGs](https://search.nixos.org/packages), [pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.org/) etc, you shouldn't have an Issue with this repo.
5. As such, **this repository does not infringe upon any copyright laws by its very nature**.
6. If you believe a copyright violation has occurred, **please direct your concerns to the original source of the content, rather than this repository or its maintainers**.
7. **We respectfully request that any DMCA takedown notices or cease and desist demands be addressed appropriately and not directed at this repository without valid grounds.**
8. In summary, all **DMCA | Copyright** **Notices will be Ignored & Not Complied With.**
