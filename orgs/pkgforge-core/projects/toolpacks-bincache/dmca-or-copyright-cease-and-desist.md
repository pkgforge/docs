# DMCA | Copyright (Cease & Desist)

{% hint style="warning" %}
All Binaries are hosted on Cloudflare, and NOT GitHub. GitHub only contains scripts & source code.
{% endhint %}

If you/your project/software uses a license which forbids binary distribution, and you would like to take down the binary:

1. First, having such clause and disallowing people to distribute binaries, will harm only your own popularity/ potential user increment
2. If you have no problems with any major package managers like [brew](https://brew.sh/), [NixPKGs](https://search.nixos.org/packages), [pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.org/) etc, you shouldn't have an Issue with this repo.
3. In summary, all **DMCA | Copyright** **Notices will be Ignored & Not Complied With.**
